						<p>
							This Terms of Service document (the "TOS") is an agreement you must accept in order to use our Services (as defined below). The terms "you" and "users" encompass all
							users. This document describes both your rights and your obligations as part of using the Services. It is important that you read it carefully because you will be
							legally bound to these terms. Volumetrics, Inc. ("Volumetrics," "we," "us") only provides its alef application and related services (as defined below) to you subject
							to this TOS. By accepting this TOS or by accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by this TOS (including the Privacy Policy, which is incorporated here
							by reference).
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are entering into this TOS on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this TOS. In that
							case, the terms "you" or "your" shall also refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this TOS, you may not use the
							Services. You acknowledge that this TOS is a contract between you and Volumetrics, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and Volumetrics,
							and it governs your use of the Services.
						</p>
						<p>
							As our business evolves, we may change this TOS. If we make a material change to the TOS, we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the changes either by
							emailing the email address associated with your account or by posting a notice on the Website. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time by
							visiting this page. The revised terms and conditions will become effective on the date set forth in our notice, and if you use the Services after that date, your use
							will constitute acceptance of the revised terms and conditions. If any change to this TOS is not acceptable to you, your only remedy is to cancel your account and
							stop using the Services, which you may do by sending an email to{' '}
